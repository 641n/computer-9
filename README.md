This is an example of a static webpage generated on GitHub Pages.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/641n/computer-9/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Static Site Generator
Jekyll is a static site generator. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak the site’s look and feel, URLs, the data displayed on the page, and more.

### Markdown

**Markdown** is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. Unlike HTML (Hyper Text **Markup** Language), it is simpler and easy to use and understand. Markdown files has a file extension of .md. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/641n/computer-9/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
